##Want to find the distribution of size for each prey fish species for each lake to determine isotope sample gradient, so we only keep fish with FLEN <=200mm.

```{r subset data for prey fish only}

preyfish <- subset(data, data$FLEN<201)

```

```{r subset data for Baby Lk. prey fish}

babyprey <- subset(preyfish, preyfish$FK_Survey_ID == "11")

##Subset by species w/ more than 10 samples - aka where we have to select on the gradient
baby_comshin <- subset(babyprey, babyprey$`Species code` == "198")
baby_pseed <- subset(babyprey, babyprey$`Species code` == "313")
baby_perch <- subset(babyprey, babyprey$`Species code` == "331")

```

```{r subset data for Daisy Lk. prey fish}

daisyprey <- subset(preyfish, preyfish$FK_Survey_ID == "14")

##Subset by species w/ more than 10 samples - aka where we have to select on the gradient
daisy_bbull <- subset(daisyprey, daisyprey$`Species code` == "233")
daisy_smb <- subset(daisyprey, daisyprey$`Species code` == "316")
