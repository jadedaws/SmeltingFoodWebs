## Project overview

### Goal

To determine the relative importance of littoral and pelagic energy sources and their transfer among trophic levels across a gradient of smelter-damaged lakes using stable isotope analyses (C13 and N15).

### Context

Over a century of intensive nickel smelting activity has caused heavy metal pollution and acidification of many lakes in the Sudbury, Ontario region. While smelter emissions have been reduced by over 95% of historical levels, allowing these lakes to begin the slow process of natural recovery, severely-damaged lakes in close proximity to the smelter require additional efforts to promote recovery. In an effort to recover the diversity and ecosystem connectivity of these heavily damaged food webs, various restoration techniques have been applied to watersheds in the region. Historically, these techniques largely focussed on achieving lake chemical recovery via neutralization and demobilization of heavy metals in the water, while newer techniques target chemical recovery of both the lake and surrounding terrestrial area to additionally restore critical linkages between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Both approaches use chemical recovery to initiate recolonization of aquatic species and enable the restoration of both ecosystem diversity and food web stability. The objective of this study is to use community surveys and stable isotope analysis to determine the recovery status and food web stability of several lakes across a gradient of remediation effort in the Sudbury region.  Improving our understanding of how chemical and biological recovery in smelter-damaged lakes is influenced by restoration treatment will provide novel insights into how these changes ultimately translate into food web recovery and stability. By quantifying and assessing the relative importance of different energy sources in recovering food webs using stable isotopes, this study will be evaluating the efficacy of freshwater restoration techniques.


### Data

Microbial community survey data was collected using fine-mesh leaf packs suspended at delta mouths for each study lake in Fall 2019. Biomass will also be calculated from these samples. In lieu of stable isotope analyses, the community data will be used to determine the functional roles of microbes present at each site.

Periphyton biomass data was collected using suspended periphyton colonization discs at each delta mouth and from representative sites along the shoreline of each basin or by the cardinal directions for smaller lakes in Fall 2019. Biomass samples were also used for stable isotope analyses.

Benthic invertebrate community survey data was collected using coarse-mesh leaf packs suspended at delta mouths for each study lake. Preserved coarse-mesh leaf pack inverts will be used to back-calculate benthic invert biomass for each lake. Stable isotope samples of mayflies were taken from representative sites along the shoreline of each basin or by the cardinal directions for smaller lakes.

Zooplankton community survey data was collected from zooplankton hauls taken at the deepest zone of each lake during July 2018. Stable isotope samples of zooplankton were taken from the deepest zone within each basin of the lake.

Fish community survey data was collected using CRADL protocol - OMNRF BsM protocol with an integrated Nordic net per depth strata, fishing at the same time as a small-mesh and large-mesh BsM for the stratum. Surveys took place from July to September 2019. Stable isotope samples of prey fish (<200mm FLEN) and large-bodied fish (>200mm FLEN) such that up to 10 isotope samples were taken per species per size group for each lake.
