# SmeltingFoodWebs

<b> Modelling food web dynamics and identifying the relative importance of different energy sources across a gradient of smelter-damaged lakes </b> :factory: :fish:

## Project overview

### Goal

### Context

### Data

Microbial community survey data from fine-mesh leaf packs suspended at delta mouths for each study lake. Biomass will also be calculated from these samples. In lieu of stable isotope analyses, the community data will be used to determine the functional roles of microbes present at each site.

Periphyton biomass data from suspended periphyton colonization discs at each delta mouth and from representative sites along the shoreline of each basin or by the cardinal directions for smaller lakes. Biomass samples were also used for stable isotope analyses.

Benthic invertebrate community survey data from coarse-mesh leaf packs suspended at delta mouths for each study lake. Preserved coarse-mesh leaf pack inverts will be used to back-calculate benthic invert biomass for each lake. Stable isotope samples of mayflies were taken from representative sites along the shoreline of each basin or by the cardinal directions for smaller lakes.

Zooplankton community survey data from zooplankton hauls taken at the deepest zone of each lake during July 2018. Stable isotope samples of zooplankton were taken from the deepest zone within each basin of the lake.

Fish community survey data using CRADL protocol - OMNRF BsM protocol with an integrated Nordic net per depth strata, fishing at the same time as a small-mesh and large-mesh BsM for the stratum. Surveys took place from July to September 2019.
